# Development

To work on the Liberty cookbook first ensure you have [Bundler][] installed.

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

Next, use [Bundler][] to install Liberty cookbook dependencies:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Finally, use [Rake][] to execute various tasks. For example:

```bash
$ rake all
```
