The __wlp__ cookbook installs and configures WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile.
It provides recipes, resources, and libraries for creating, managing, and configuring Liberty profile server instances.

## Basic configuration

The __wlp__ cookbook can install Liberty profile from jar archives or a zip file. The installation method is configured via the `node[:wlp][:install_method]` attribute. 

### jar installation

When jar archives installation method is used the `node[:wlp][:archive][:base_url]` attribute must be set to specify the base location from which the Liberty jar archives can be downloaded. Use the `node[:wlp][:archive][:runtime][...]`, `node[:wlp][:archive][:extended][...]`, and `node[:wlp][:archive][:extras][...]` attributes (described below) to adjust jar archive file names, checksums, and other installation options. You must also set the `node[:wlp][:archive][:accept_license]` attribute to `true` if you agree and accept the license terms of the Liberty profile software. The jar archive-based installation will fail if `node[:wlp][:archive][:accept_license]` is not set to `true`. 


By default the cookbook is configured with jar archive installation method. The archive installation options are pre-configured with values based on developer licensed Liberty profile. 

The no-fee developer licensed Liberty profile jar archives can be downloaded from [Liberty download page](https://www.ibmdw.net/wasdev/downloads/websphere-application-server-liberty-profile/) on [WASdev](https://www.ibmdw.net/wasdev) site. The production licensed Liberty profile jar archives can be obtained from [IBM Passport Advantage](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/).

### zip installation

When zip installation method is used only the `node[:wlp][:zip][:url]` attribute must be set to specify the location of the zip file. The zip is assumed to be generated by running `./bin/server package` Liberty command with `--include=all` or `--include=minify` option.
